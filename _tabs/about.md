# üîß Alessandro Magnosi (klezVirus)

> *"Just a noob with a passion for what runs under the hood."*

Hi, I‚Äôm Alessandro, but I go with the nick "klez". I like to explore how things work under the surface. From undocumented syscalls to adversarial AI models, I enjoy poking at the edges of systems, breaking things (sometimes gently), and sharing what I learn along the way.

I'm a proud member of the [SpecterOps](https://specterops.io) Adversary Simulation Team!  

## Trivia

People often ask ‚Äî *why Klez virus?* Well, Klez wasn‚Äôt the most technically advanced malware out there 
(especially compared to Stuxnet or Mydoom), but it still wreaked havoc: it infected around 7 
million computers and caused nearly **\$20 billion** in damages (primarily from cleanup and recovery 
efforts). 

I chose **klezVirus** as a moniker because I‚Äôm drawn to simplicity: real intelligence lies in reducing 
complexity, not adding layers. That doesn't mean it's not creative or dangerous; sometimes the most 
effective solutions aren‚Äôt the most complicated ones, and you can achieve significant impact through
clear, clever execution.

## ‚ú¶ Things I care about:

* üß¨ **Windows Internals** (user & kernel mode): I dig through APIs, system calls, and obscure Windows internals just for the fun of it ‚Äî and occasionally to build something useful.
* ü§ñ **AI & Machine Learning**: I'm fascinated by how models behave, how they break, and how they can be secured (or abused). Researching ML security feels like cheating at science.
* ‚õì **Blockchain & Distributed Systems**: I enjoy experimenting with trustless networks, identity models, and how distributed systems can be misused or protected.
* ü§ù **Community, Sharing & FOSS**: Whether it‚Äôs at conferences, webinars, or late-night blog posts ‚Äî I love connecting with people, learning from them, and giving back to the open-source world.

## ‚ú¶ Some things I‚Äôve worked on:

* üîÑ **Call Stack & System-Call Obfuscation**: StackMoonwalk, Half-Moon, and creative abuse of RPC threading models (\[Blog]\[1], \[LinkedIn]\[2]).
* üí• **Bypassing Modern Defenses**: Building PoCs that explore how mitigations can fail (and how defenders can adapt).
* üé§ **Speaking at Conferences**: DEF CON, x33fcon, HITB, BruCON, RomHack ‚Äî sharing small insights from my research, always learning more than I give (\[YouTube]\[3]).
* üõ† **Open Source Projects**: Tools like Inceptor and StackMoonwalk, developed with friends and collaborators at Porchetta Industries and beyond (\[infosecurity.us]\[4]).

## üåê Affiliations

* **SpecterOps** ‚Äî Senior Security Consultant in their Security Testing team ([SpecterOps](https://specterops.io)).
