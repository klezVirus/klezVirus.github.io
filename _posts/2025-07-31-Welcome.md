# Welcome!

As of **July 31, 2025**, I’ve completely restyled this blog to make it more accessible, more readable, and hopefully more useful to anyone diving into the weird and wonderful corners of cybersecurity.

I am Alessandro (aka klezVirus), and I’m a curious mind with a deep love for Windows internals, AI, and distributed systems. I’m not here to pretend I have all the answers — I’m still learning, and this space is where I try to make sense of the things I explore.

This blog exists to simplify. I believe that the real power of knowledge lies in making complex things understandable — not by dumbing them down, but by breaking them into pieces that anyone can build back up. Whether it’s undocumented syscalls, quirky kernel behaviors, adversarial machine learning, or how blockchains keep themselves honest, I’ll do my best to walk through it all step-by-step.

## Topics You’ll Likely See

* **Windows Internals**: From userland shenanigans to kernel-mode exploration and system call tricks.
* **AI & ML Security**: How models behave under pressure, and how to secure them (or confuse them).
* **Distributed Systems**: Identity, consensus, and creative misuse in trustless networks.
* **FOSS & Research Sharing**: Demos, PoCs, and thoughts on the tools I work on or love.

If anything catches your eye, or if you're stuck on a related topic — feel free to reach out. I’ll be happy if this blog helps someone out there the same way others have helped me.

Let’s learn together.
